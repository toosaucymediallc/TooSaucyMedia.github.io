After 15+ years of dedicated service in the dynamic field of accounting, my journey from an Accounting Assistant to the role of Accounting Manager at a prominent public company was marked by invaluable experiences.
​
The decision to start The Bookkeepers was fueled by a passion for redefining how businesses perceive and utilize their financial resources. From my early days meticulously managing accounts as an assistant to steering the financial ship of a public company, every step of my journey has been a lesson in the pivotal role played by accurate bookkeeping and strategic accounting.
​
In the corporate landscape, I recognized a growing need for a service that goes beyond the conventional.
